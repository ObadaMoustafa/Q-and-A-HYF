^ Hi, we need to create promises in real life/projects or we just handle the promises when we take from fetch? Is there any other way to get information from websites other than API's? Thank you.

- db
- API
- fetch

^(1) I've seen that response.ok expression is used within an if statement in order to detect a request error. I'm wondering that is it the best practice to implement a request error handling right after a fetch() within try and for the other errors to use .catch()?

^(2) I've read that even if I forget to use await expression in the function, attached try...catch or then...catch statements keep working. So what if I forget to use await expression (I experienced it for a short amount of time :slightly_smiling_face: ), how I can I test that my function still works as expected?

*Jalal
^ Should we always use try and catch with async, in other words, should we always wrap the body of the function in try?

*Nojdar
^ Can you maybe give us some cons and pros about both methods?
